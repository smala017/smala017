    <h1>
        Airport Flights Map
    </h1>
    <p>
        I have a year's worth of flight data from many airports around the US. For each flight, I have its airline, departure and arrival airports, and its arrival delay. I also have more information about each airline and each airport, including coordinates of each airport. I would like to make a map that maps all of these flights geographically, showing the connections between different airports. This map should be able to be filtered by airport or airline. I also want the user to see the empirical delay on each flight. Perhaps one airline is delayed less frequently, and is therefore a better option for the consumer.
