1. Map of USA with circles representing airports.

2. Size of circles represent the number of flights to and from each airport.

3. Edges between each airport representing the amount of flights connecting the two.

4. Menu for filtering flights by airport (arrival / departure), airline, and delay. 

5. Interactivity by clicking on the map itself; i.e. clicking on an airport's bubble will select that airport in particular. 

6. Maybe: Color code the edges, broken up by airline? 

 

Unfortunately, I encountered problems I could not overcome and do not have any features implemented yet.

PROBLEMS:

1) I could not figure out how to draw the state boundaries on the map. I kept getting the following error for each state: Error: <path> attribute d: Expected number, "MNaN,NaNLNaN,NaNLâ€¦". I also am unable to plot circles for some reason. I think there is something going wrong because I am using the USA GeoJSON data instead of the World, and the transforming isn't happening correctly, I don't know I can't figure it out. 

2) How do I load in a csv function into a data variable in d3 that I can then use *outside* of the "then" function? It's frustrating not having it guaranteed that the code will run sequentially.
