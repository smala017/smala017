        <h3>2-3 Questions a User Might Have</h3>
        <p>1. Which airports are the most frequestly-visited?</p>
        <p>2. Which airlines provide the best on-time service from my local airport?</p>
        <p>3. Which airports most frequently suffer delays?</p>

        <h3>Visualization Strategies</h3>
        <p>1. Map of airports geographically, with bubbles representing each airport and edges between the nodes representing the amount of direct connections between the two. A user can alter this map via filters and via hovering/clicking on nodes directly.</p>
        <p>2. Bar charts showing the percentage of flights which are delayed by airline, within the applied filters.</p>
